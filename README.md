Please note that despite the license applied to this mod, such license
is obviously not valid for High Quality Quake. They are only here due
to insistence of a few friends. This commit
<https://github.com/ceular/devotion/commit/b3ddf1a6f04633add631ff5c4b75eda7448ee7c5> references all such assets that aren't GPLv2.

# Documentation

Since this is a partial conversion, not everything previously found in
RatArena will work here, namely the extra medals, rail trails, status
bars, LG beams, alternate announcers (here we use the default for Quake
III), Team Arena items and weapons, grenade skins and maybe one or
another cosmetic setting to achieve consistency. For everything else,
the documentation available at <https://ratmod.github.io/> serves well
for Devotion.

# Building
